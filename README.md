# User Centric Front End Milestone Project

## Gardeners Ltd

### Specification
This website is a front end only website that conveys the information and services that Gardeners Ltd provide. A user can understand the services that the company provides, see pictures of previous previous work completed and contact the company for quotations on upcoming work.

### Process
The website will be built in three distinguishing stages. 
  - Write HTML to define structure
  - Applying Bootstrap Framework
  - Write CSS to finalise Styling

### Features
Within the website there is  a home page with a full width banner, as a focal point for the user when they first access the site. The gallery page uses a carosel style that allows the user to scroll through the photos that are available. If the user doesn't scroll through the pictures then it will automatically scroll.

### Technologies
This website is built using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap. 
  - First the HTML was coded to supply the structure.
  - The Bootstrap framework was then applied to give a basis styling.
  - CSS was then coded to override the styling elements of the bootstrap to give the individual style that is seen in the end result.
